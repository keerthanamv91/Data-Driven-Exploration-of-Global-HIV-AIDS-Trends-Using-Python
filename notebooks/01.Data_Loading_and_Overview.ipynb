Although significant progress has been made in medical treatment and prevention, the burden of HIV/AIDS is not evenly distributed. Some countries continue to experience high infection rates and mortality, while others show improvement due to better healthcare infrastructure and treatment access.\n","\n","**A** major concern is the variation in access to preventive measures and antiretroviral therapy (ART). In several regions, limited healthcare resources, lack of awareness, and social barriers hinder effective disease control. As a result, understanding country-wise and regional differences in HIV prevalence, AIDS-related deaths, and treatment coverage is essential for informed decision-making and targeted interventions.\n","\n","**T**he dataset used in this project provides detailed information on the number of people living with HIV, deaths due to HIV/AIDS, adult infection rates (ages 19–45), prevention of mother-to-child transmission estimates, and ART coverage among adults and children.\n","\n","**T**here is a strong need to analyze this data systematically to identify trends, uncover hidden patterns, and detect gaps in treatment and prevention efforts. Through exploratory data analysis and effective visualizations, this project aims to highlight global and regional disparities and evaluate whether the HIV/AIDS situation is improving or worsening over time. The insights gained can assist healthcare organizations, policymakers, and stakeholders in strengthening disease surveillance, improving health monitoring, and supporting evidence-based public health strategies."],"metadata":{"id":"pzSr29QFaios"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Dataset :**\n","\n","The dataset comprises data on the number of people living with HIV, sourced from authoritative organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNESCO.\n","\n","The data set contains data on:\n","\n","1.
