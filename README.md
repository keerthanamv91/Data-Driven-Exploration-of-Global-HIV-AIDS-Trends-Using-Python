This project analyzes the global HIV/AIDS situation using data sourced from WHO and UNESCO. The dataset includes indicators related to HIV prevalence, deaths, treatment coverage, and demographic impact. The goal is to understand which countries are most affected, whether the situation is improving, and how health interventions such as ART (Anti-Retroviral Therapy) are impacting outcomes.

📂 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗰𝗲

  • World Health Organization (WHO)

  • UNESCO

𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗜𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝗱𝗲𝘀

  • This dataset contains multiple health indicators such as:

  • Number of people living with HIV/AIDS

  • Number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS

  • HIV cases among adults (19–45 years)

  • PMTCT (Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission) estimates

  • ART coverage among people living with HIV

  • ART coverage among children living with HIV

𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁

During global epidemics, understanding the status of HIV/AIDS is critical.

𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘁 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿:

  • What is the current burden of HIV/AIDS globally?

  • Which countries have the highest prevalence?

  • Is the situation improving or worsening?

  • How effective is ART coverage?

  • What age groups are most affected?

  • Are interventions reducing deaths over time?

🎯 𝗔𝗶𝗺 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁

  🏁 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗰𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the global HIV/AIDS situation using reliable health indicators from WHO and UNESCO. Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations, the study highlights the countries and populations most affected, examines trends in cases and deaths, and evaluates the impact of interventions such as ART and PMTCT.

The insights generated here can support policymakers, researchers, and public-health professionals in understanding the epidemic’s progression and identifying areas that require increased attention. While significant progress has been made in many regions, the data also reveals persistent challenges, especially related to treatment access and adult HIV prevalence. Continued analysis and updated datasets will further help track global progress toward reducing HIV/AIDS burden.

This project serves as a foundation for deeper analytical work, predictive modeling, and health-policy decision making.
